Polygon map file format version 1 is as defined:

The first line is "poly", the header.
The second line is the version of the format, 1.
The third line contains an integer, N, which is how many polygons there are.
Then follows N lines for each polygon:
    NOTE: Every number below will be separated by spaces.
    The first integer M is how many points there are in the poly.
    Then follows 2*M (possibly non-integer) numbers in the form
        x1 y1 x2 y2 [...] xM yM
    such that the ith point has coordinates {xi, yi}.

Assume that the polygons do not contain any self-intersections.
To get the traversable area, take the symmetric difference of ALL polygons.
