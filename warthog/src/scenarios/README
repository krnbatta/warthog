Problem instances generated by Daniel Harabor: 
--------------------------------------------------

Each of these problem sets comprises 100 randomly generated instances on maps
from various benchmark sets taken from the HOG pathfinding library
(http://hog2.googlecode.com)

adaptive-depth: problems for each of the 12 adaptive-depth maps found in HOG.

bgmaps: problem instances for each of the 120 Baldur's Gate maps fround in HOG.

bgmaps/softobs: instances for variants of the 120 Baldur's Gate maps.  Each
traversable node in the original maps was turned into an obstacle with various
probability: 5%, 10%, 20% etc.

rooms: problem instances for each of the 300 Rooms maps found in HOG.

e3x3: 100 problems for scaled-up versions of each of the maps in:
adaptive-depth, bgmaps and rooms.  In order to generate these problems, each map
was scaled by a factor of 3.

movingai: various problem sets for a variety of benchmarks: mazes, Baldur's
Gate, Dragon Age and Rooms. In most cases the instances on each map are nicely 
distributed by problem length. All were taken from http://movingai.com

NB: with the exception of Dragon Age (./movingai/dao), these instances were
generated on scaled up 512x512 variants of the original maps.
